## About Me

I would like the ability to continue research from my home.  

$smitting on cash app    

even $5 helps, I can't afford a pack of smokes and I'm out.

I didn't go the route that got me money, I tried to build a small business to help other small businesses and 2008 destroyment.  I chose college instead of the easy money for .com and graduated in 2001 and moved to Phoenix on 8/13/2001.  At least all my code still runs, I guess.  I just wish I had more than 4 pennies, but I feel the world is punishing me for giving a shit.
